# kicad-database-utils

Some basic utils for creating and managing a database of electronic components,
for use as a database library for KiCad.

This is likely only useful for my particular workflow.

## Setup

Use your preferred python environment management tool. With venv:

```
# create a new venv in a location of your choice, e.g. kicad-database-utils/.venv
python -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment
# activate the venv
source /path/to/new/virtual/environment/bin/activate
# install requirements
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
